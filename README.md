Automation
==========

This is a small project for a university class. The intended purpose of this library is only educational. It is supposed to show how different abstract machines work and how they could be represented. As of now, the machines which are going to be included are:

* Deterministic finite automata
* Nondeterministic finite automata
* Deterministic pushdown automata
* Nondeterministic pushdown automata
* Deterministic Turing Machine
* Nondeterministic Turing Machine
* Moore machine
* Mealy machine
